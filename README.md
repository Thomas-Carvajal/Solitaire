This is a solitaire project I wrote for one of my classes. Below is the rough outline of the coding process I went through to create the project!

create deck and deals it in increasing order to begin game
create functions for different possible moves from tableau/waste to foundation
create function to check the win and display board after move
user input string which corresponds to a move 
loop until user inputs 'quit' string
call function based on user input string 
declare if move is valid 
display move
reprompt for next move
stop when user quits or game is won
